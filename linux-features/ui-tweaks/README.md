# UI Tweaks

`ui-tweaks` is an optional Linux feature for small ChatGPT Desktop UI
customizations. It is disabled by default and is intended as a shared place for
future visual tweaks that are useful to some Linux users but should not affect
the baseline app.

Enable it in the local, gitignored feature config:

```json
{
  "enabled": ["ui-tweaks"]
}
```

## Tweaks

| Tweak | Patch module | What it does | Settings |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `appearance.dockIcon` | `patches/dock-icon.js` | Exposes the upstream Appearance setting for switching Linux windows and the system tray between the official ChatGPT and Codex icons. | `tweaks.appearance.dockIcon.enabled` |
| `modelPicker.showModelsByDefault` | `patches/model-picker-model-list.js` | Opens the advanced picker by default and shows model choices inline instead of hiding them behind the compact Power slider and a nested Model submenu. | `tweaks.modelPicker.showModelsByDefault.enabled` |
| `reasoning.keepEffortLabelsEnglish` | `patches/reasoning-effort-labels.js` | Keeps reasoning effort values in English in the Simplified Chinese UI while leaving the surrounding interface translated. | `tweaks.reasoning.keepEffortLabelsEnglish.enabled` |
| `sidebar.projectName` | `patches/sidebar-project-name.js` | Styles project names in the left sidebar project list. It does not style `Projects` / `Chats` section headings and does not style chat rows. | `tweaks.sidebar.projectName.enabled`, `tweaks.sidebar.projectName.style` |

## Settings

Tracked defaults live in `feature.json`, but local preferences should not be
edited there. Put user-specific overrides in the gitignored
`linux-features/features.json` file under `settings.ui-tweaks`.

Example local config:

```json
{
  "enabled": ["ui-tweaks"],
  "settings": {
    "ui-tweaks": {
      "tweaks": {
        "sidebar": {
          "projectName": {
            "style": "font-weight: 800 !important; color: red;"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Each tweak documents its own config keys below.

### `appearance.dockIcon`

Exposes the upstream Dock icon selector on Linux and stages the original PNG
resources from the current macOS bundle. The selected icon is applied to open
and restored Electron windows and to the system tray. On KDE Plasma, the tweak
also creates and updates a managed user-local desktop entry so a pinned taskbar
launcher follows the selected icon. Existing user-managed desktop entries remain
untouched.

This tweak is independently disabled by default. Enable it while keeping the
rest of `ui-tweaks` configurable:

```json
{
  "enabled": ["ui-tweaks"],
  "settings": {
    "ui-tweaks": {
      "tweaks": {
        "appearance": {
          "dockIcon": {
            "enabled": true
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Config keys:

- `enabled`: `true` applies the three Dock icon descriptors and stages their
  resources. `false` skips Dock-specific asset checks and removes any staged
  Dock icon payload without disabling other UI tweaks.

### `modelPicker.showModelsByDefault`

Makes the detailed model list the default Codex composer picker view. The model
rows are rendered inline, so newly available families such as GPT-5.6 Luna,
Terra, and Sol remain visible without first switching away from the compact
Power slider or opening a nested Model submenu. The compact GPT-5.6 Power
slider also derives Sol's positions from the model's `supportedReasoningEfforts`
after the app filters that list through the reasoning efforts enabled in
settings. Enabled efforts such as Max therefore appear without maintaining a
separate hard-coded effort list.

Config keys:

- `enabled`: `true` applies the tweak, `false` keeps the feature enabled but
  leaves the upstream model picker unchanged.

### `reasoning.keepEffortLabelsEnglish`

Leaves the reasoning effort values as `None`, `Minimal`, `Low`, `Medium`,
`High`, `XHigh`, `Max`, and `Ultra` in the Simplified Chinese locale. The
surrounding picker title and usage warning remain translated. This avoids
collapsing distinct upstream values such as `XHigh` and `Ultra` into the same
Chinese label.

Config keys:

- `enabled`: `true` applies the tweak, `false` keeps the feature enabled but
  uses the upstream translated effort labels.

### `sidebar.projectName`

Styles project names in the left sidebar project list.

Tracked default in `feature.json`:

```json
{
  "tweaks": {
    "sidebar": {
      "projectName": {
        "enabled": true,
        "style": "font-weight: 700 !important; padding-top: 0.25rem;"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Config keys:

- `enabled`: `true` applies the tweak, `false` keeps the feature enabled but
  skips this specific tweak.
- `style`: CSS declaration list inserted into the project-name rule, such as
  `font-weight: 800 !important; color: red;`. It is not arbitrary CSS; unsafe
  syntax that could escape the scoped rule warns and falls back to the default.
  The default is `font-weight: 700 !important; padding-top: 0.25rem;`, so
  project names are bold with a small top offset and no color is forced.

## Drift Behavior

The patches are fail-soft. If upstream bundle markers drift, the feature writes
a `WARN` message and leaves the asset unchanged. Missing Dock icon resources
also warn, remove only the Dock icon payload, and do not fail the build. Invalid
style values warn and fall back to the default bold style. The feature should
not block install, rebuild, or packaging flows.

## Adding Tweaks

Add each tweak as a focused module under `patches/`, register it from `patch.js`,
document its JSON settings here, and add coverage in `test.js`.

Run the feature tests with:

```bash
node --test linux-features/ui-tweaks/test.js
```
